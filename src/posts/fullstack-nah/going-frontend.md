Before I begin, I'll acknowledge there are many full-stack developers out there and I'm not writing this to disparage anyone or say that there aren't really valid times where having the ability to work across the whole stack is valuable, in fact, I've done this lots in my career so far, I'm just writing about my experiences and opinions. I think that true passion and love of work, at least for me, comes from the ability to become a specialist and work on things that spark joy. Also, it's true that you don't have to passionate about your work but I do think there is something in being satisfied about the work you do.

## Getting that first development job

I started out professionally in the software industry in 2014 as a Student developer at a local software company. I'll always treasure this experience, I learnt from many really talented and experienced developers and learnt a lot about software development practices, and even experienced the company going through the agile software transformation. I stayed on at the company until 2018, throughout my time I picked up lots in skills in both backend and frontend development, with a focus on frontend development. This is starting to feel like a cover letter for a CV so let's try to get back on track.

One of the things I picked up on during my time there was the real value that can be gained from true experts in their field, one of the departments I really got this from was QA (Testers). Having dedicated roles for quality really pays off, I can't count the number of times I got called out (in a good way) for some crappy code I wrote which had some glaring issues, and the feature was all the better for it. Something that is really important to note here is that this company did not fall into the trap of removing their QA roles as part of their agile transition, unlike some - where suddenly everyone is a developer and tester and therefore, no one actually tests anything anymore. The QA's were dedicated team members responsible for both automated user scenario testing and manually exploratory or scripted testing.
Another role which I really came to appreciate as important was a dedicated product owners as part of the team, responsible for helping the team work on the important things and ensuring that the team are empowered.

In terms of development work, I was pretty happy here, whilst I didn't have a dedicated role, I did get the opportunity to grow in the area which I enjoy the most "Frontend development", it was more or less here an unwritten rule that people specialise, because to be honest, I believe that is the only way things can ever work.

So why am I writing this article? Well, my second experience was very different. The second company, was a very big company that loves the colour blue.
Here things were really different, at least in my department I can't speak for every department. I joined a scrappy new department, where "all our developers are full-stack", this should have been a red flag.

## All of our developers are full-stack

It's at this point I'll say I don't think my problem is specifically with the Full-stack developer role, in a small start up for example I'm sure it's really important to hire people that can make a large impact.
My issue is when Full-Stack actually means - We expect our developers to half ass (or completely suck at) all of the following roles:

- Div Soup Developer (Frontend)
- CRUDdy Developer (Backend)
- Whoever touched the DB last owns it (Backend DB)
- Works on my machine (Tester)
- Fuck it, we can get it working once it's merged into main (DevOps)
- Sit in meetings all day to arguing about stuff (Product owner/manager/architect)
- Organise all the meetings and also decide what the team needs to be doing (Scrum master)

Oh, and you have 6 weeks to deliver the project btw.

This isn't to say that it isn't a developers responsibility to have the ability to adapt to many of these areas at any time in their job, but I guess what I'm saying is each of these are a specialism that deserve someone in your team to provide expertise.

When I was working on code in this environment, I never really felt like I was growing new skills or learning new technology it was always doing things in the safest/quickest way possible which would ensure that quarterly deadlines were met, there was no time to do all the things that I think developers should be doing:

- Allowing developers time to try things out and fail
- Focusing on accessibility
- Focusing on performance
- Collaborating with QA to ensure the users are getting a good experience
- Collaborating with other devs in the other application areas, each who have their own expertise
- Working with Design and Product owners to find good solutions
- Thinking about future ways to improve processes or developer experience
- Experimenting with new technology
- Sharing your knowledge and receiving valuable feedback from other domain experts.
- All the other things I can't think of right now.

The ironic thing I've found about "full-stack developers" is things still pretty much came down to you worked on what you were best at (or most recently did) e.g. I pretty much worked mostly on the Frontend. However, not having the structures in place to allow people to specialise and grow in expertise seemed to result in job satisfaction diminishing, at least that's how I felt. Yes, things weren't all doom and gloom but my development felt pretty stagnant, and it did feel like negativity was constantly brewing. There were some scenarios where developers were given the opportunities to try to focus on their chosen specialism, however all of these were relegated to "extra curricular" guilds. Oh boy, agile guilds, all I can say is fuck Spotify for trying to popularise that one, in my experience guilds have mostly just been excuses for management to add in a 3rd, 4th or 5th additional role to a developers normal day job.

The last thing I'll say on generalists is it tends to result in managers treating developers as resources which can be moved around on a whim, I'll always find it funny that I was asked if I was interested in leading Testing related efforts in my department, despite that fact I knew very little about that, they were just trying to tick a box in a spreadsheet.

## So what is my current role like?

There's been a lot of moaning in this article, sorry about that, I am truly grateful for all of my experiences but I think it's good to reflect on things and try to figure out why I feel really happy and on a good trajectory in my new role.

As I mentioned at the start, I recently started a new role and things are going really well, I'm super happy and I honestly believe that one of the biggest reasons for this is I'm finally not just a "Software developer" I've been given the remit and excuse as a Frontend Developer to focus on what is it I'm really passionate about.

I did however have some hesitations about "migrating" from a Software developer/engineer to a "Frontend" focused dev, which I had to get over, namely people in the past saying to me:

- You do Frontend... don't you get paid less for that?
- Don't restrict yourself to just Frontend.
- That's not real software development (serious quote from someone, not like they were doing anything useful either).

It's fair to say over the years I've gotten general vibes from other devs that seemed to, for some reason or another, regard frontend development as some how less than other types of dev, although now I'm quite happy enough to say fuck 'em.

The "Don't restrict yourself" argument I could give some pause with, whilst I can see the merits of having the ability to work across different areas (and am quite capable of), I'm seeing some huge positives in finally having a specialism in my job title:

- Receiving fantastic PR reviews and comments from Frontend peers, who provide excellent feedback and new ideas into the mix.
- Having regular meetings with like minded frontend devs to discuss technologies and approaches.
- Having the opportunity to explore new technologies and architectures, discussing the merits and tradeoffs.
- Having the time to focus on core "frontend things". For example, I spent two days last sprint focusing purely on keyboard interactivity on the feature i'd been working.
- Being allowed the time to fail and try new things.

All of these things can be done by hiring generalists but the general vibe I get is you can attract people who are super passionate and interested in their specialism.
One of the big reasons why do I have time to focus on these things is because all the other people in the team have got my back:

- We have dedicated and specialised in team QA's.
- We have awesome in team product managers/owners, they also spend a lot of time taking the time to organise refinement meetings to help make us understand the work we need to do, ensuring that we are focusing on the right thing.
- We have fantastic backend devs.

I don't find myself feeling guilty about spending time on focusing on only frontend things, I'm not slowly the team down or making us not reach goals, I'm just doing my job the best that I can.

### Looking forward

I'm not saying I'll never change career path ever again, and I'm not really worried if I have to reskill, I'm just saying that I'm happy that I finally feel like I have the space to specialise and become an expert as part of my job function.

I do know what I'm definitely saying is if your company a few years ago decided to make everyone developers that can do everything and are trying to share one or two product managers between 4 or 5 teams, yeah probably don't do that. I really hope that managers at some point realise they can't hire 1 person to do 5 peoples jobs and expect that will create a good environment, and I think some of that all starts with hiring just one type of developer (the full stacker).

Incidentally, a weird fact, I've only ever worked for companies that start with the letter `I` which is a bit weird, maybe I have a type.

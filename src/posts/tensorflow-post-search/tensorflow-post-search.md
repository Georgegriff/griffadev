title: Playing with Natural language search for blog posts using TensorflowJS
description: I've been learning TensorflowJS and Machine Learning, as an experiment I thought I would implement a naive search across my current blog posts using sentence similarity on natural language running in the browser.

- Create small snippets of functional code.
- Explain input data, summary sentences only, not blog content.
- Running in the browser benefits/tradeoffs. Running on the GPU
- Explain not a good way to do search, just an experiment
- Exposing blog posts as an API with 11ty
- Link out json feed spec and 11ty blog starter
- TF JS models universal-sentence-encoder, show example of similarity of sentences
- Show problem though my maths that added was not on the gpu
- Dot product implementation explanation
- Blocking the main thread
- Using Comlink
- Productionize thoughts
- Future ideas for experiments: Text summarization of blog posts
- link to other resources

Sometimes I get asked about places where you can go to learn about different topics. This post is my attempt to collate some of the resource that I've found helpful in my journey through software engineering. Some of these might also just be tools that I've used or I think are cool.

These links aren't the full extent of the things I've been learning. I think the best way to learn new things is to be inquisitive on the job and try to get exposure to different aspects of software not just Frontend or Backend alone. Don't be afraid to dive in head first and just experiment and ask questions!

## Twitter Accounts

Twitter used to be great for developer stuff but many people have left twitter after Elon.

My follow list might give you some starting points, but not all are tech, it's not curated, but bio's should help with finding more stuff. https://twitter.com/griffadev/following

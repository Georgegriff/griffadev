tagline: When i've started side projects in the past, i felt like i dug into code too quickly, without thinking about what I actually was building first, i wanted to try something a bit different this time.

I've been working with web technologies for the best part of a decade now, from my first terrible attempts at building websites in tools like `Adobe Dreamweaver`, to building complex apps in my day jobs, using frontend and backend technologies (a lot of `JavaScript`).

However, something i've never had is a place of my own on the internet to just put stuff, so that's what I wanted to build, also it's probably another place I can just post pictures of my cats.
This article details some of the first steps that I took along the journey to building [griffa.dev](https://griffa.dev).

> It's at this point of writing this blog post I got very distracted, trying to find an appropriate picture. Maybe I should have titled this post: How to not get distracted whilst working on a new project, it even occurred to me to write a component to auto generate a picture of my cats, probably would've been worth it.

## Building a personal blog

Not very original, I know, but as part of this project I wanted to try and strip things back to basics, escape from the `Webpacky Reacty Hook Hell`, and just build a nice static site.

### Getting inspired

I watch `a lot` of YouTube, mostly Gaming related content, but over the years i've watched several programming related channels, one of the best, and most well known of which is [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA).

The specific video that got me really inspired to build something myself was:

- What is it you're  building
- Why are you building it and who is it for
- Planning things out github projects/trello
- Come up with a design

- Awareness of technology options or existing projects to draw inspiration from
- web.dev
- dev.to
- openwc

- Design + Youtube
